# ðŸ“šBooks Management SystemðŸ“—ðŸ“•ðŸ“˜ðŸ“™ Using JDBC and Servlet

## About the Project

This is a layered application as a dynamic web project created on Eclipse IDE using MYSQL Database and the server used here is Tomcat.Here I have used Advanced Java
technologies like JDBC and Servlet.The web project consists of boostraped styled html pages as user interface called as home.html which serves as the welcome
file in the deployment web page.There is a user interface form with various options like
- **Add Book**
- **Search Book** 
- **Update Book**
-  **Delete Book**

providing facility to  the user with all the details in the database.The project allows to add the book details into the database, search a book from the database with book ID
Update any book details for wrong input and also delete a book with detais from the database permanently. It has 3 Layers 
- Controller Layer
- Service Layer
- Data Layer/DAO Layer

In the server side I have used Servlet component for each module allowing CRUD Operations(Create,Retrieve,Update,Delete).
